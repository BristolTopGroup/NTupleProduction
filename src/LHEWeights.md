Documentation can be found on the twiki: https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMS/LHEReaderCMSSW
In our case the TTbar weights mapping is:

IDs for PDF variations can be mapped as follows:
 - 2001 to 2100: NNPDF3.0NLO (default PDF, central + 100 variations, alpha_s = 0.130)
 - 2101: NNPDF3.0 with alpha_s varied to 0.118
 - 2102: NNPDF3.0 with alpha_s varied to 0.119
 - 3001 to 3055: CT10
 - 4001 to 4056: unknown
